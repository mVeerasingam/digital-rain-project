# Digital Rain

## Introduction
As part of our ATU Software and Electronic "C++ Programming" final year module. Our project for this module was to create a matrix style "digital rain" inspired by the iconic 1999 movie "The Matrix"!!! We used our skills learnt from this module, in OOP programming style develop the code and algorithms needed to produce this effect.
